								<h2>My First Days</h2>
								<p>I was born in small town Muskogee, Oklahoma on October 24, 1993. I was raised in a fairly selcluded area without many neighbors, so as a child I spend much of my time outside and reading. It forced me to be more observant and take in my surroundings. The more I did this the more interested in nature I would become. This eventually would lead me to pursue science</p>
							</div>

							<div class="tile">
								<h2>Starting College</h2>
								<p>I was finally off to college. I was young and eager, my header brimming with visions of what my first year on campus would be like. I spent 3 years at the Univserity of Oklahoma, studying physics and getting to be a part and even guide a research team on our pursuit to make new discoveries. It was there that I had my first experience with programming and fell in love -- even if I didn't realize it at the time</p>
							</div>

							<div class="tile">
								<h2>Now</h2>
								<p>I would soon leave the university due to a myriad of issues, but my love of science and programming would stick with me. I was unsure of what my future would hold, but I knew what I wanted to do. I picked up books and read, then read some more, and when I had finished I read a few more. I studied and learned everything I could about programming and Web-Development, both Front and Backend. I found clients, I contracted work, I've held a few positions, and this is where we are today.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="column-right">
							<div class="tile">
								<h2>Early Life</h2>
								<p>I become obsessed with the extreme facets of nature: tornados, volcanos, earthquakes and the like. I was going through school and was learning as much as I could about the chemisty and physics that were underlying these things. In my junior year of high school I decided I wanted to major and Mathematics and Physics and become a Physicist</p>
							</div>

							<div class="tile">
								<h2>Ending College</h2>
								<p>I spent a lot of time programming in ForTran and C++. If you have ever programmed in ForTran then I'm sure you can understand why I didn't realize my love immediately. The work I worked at the however the more I discovered that it wasn't the Math, the Science, or even the programming that really drove me to learn -- it was solving problems</p>
							</div>	
							<div class="tile">
								<h2>And Forward</h2>
								<p>I have around 6 years of programming experience and over 3 years of experience working with multiple different Web technologies in multiple different environments. I am just as passionate about learning and solving problems as I was then. In a way, I would venture to say even more so now. I'm always seeking new career opportunities, free-lance opportunities, writing outlets, and excuses to work with new, innovative web technologies</p>
