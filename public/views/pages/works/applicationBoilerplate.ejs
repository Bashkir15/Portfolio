				<p>This application was a little bit different for me in the fact that it is a purely server side boilerplate</p>

				<p>The goal of this application was to be a quick start for Node application developers. It packages together some of the most commonly used features when developing an application, such as authentication, social-media aspects, and forum aspects that are all easily customizable</p>

				<ul class='single-work-list'>
					<li>What features are the most commonly used?</li>
					<li>How can I make this customizable?</li>
					<li>What are the best performance improvements I can make that allow this to scale?</li>
				</ul>

				<div class='single-work-list-problem'>
					<p>I browsed around on github looking at node projects and collected a list of the most common implementations for applications. I was able to put together something fairly comprehensive</p>

					<ul class='single-work-list'>
						<li>Authentication was paramount</li>
						<li>A lot of sites were social media based with timelines, friends, and messages</li>
						<li>Many applications were forum or board applications similar to reddit</li>
					</ul>

					<p>With these things in mind it was fairly easy to get started on the boilerplate</p>

					<p>I used Mongo at the start, but eventually will probably refactor the code to allow for more database choices for customizability</p>

					<p>I created the data models and the controllers for each of these functionalities and then hooked them up to route extensions to create a simple and easy to use api</p>

				<h3>Conclusion</h3>

				<p>While there are many things I would like to improve about this application since it was written before ES6 was standardized, it still serves as a good boilerplate for applications. The api is easy to customize and only use what you need. In the future I would like to rewrite the code in ES6 and make a few performance enhancements</p>
