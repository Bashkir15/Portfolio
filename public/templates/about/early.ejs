		<h3>Early Life:</h3>

	<div class='about-section-right'>
		<p>I was brought into this world on October 24, 1993 in the small town of Muskogee, Oklahoma. By a young age I had decided that one day I was going to be a scientist. I would go on to spend hours watching documentaries on the things I found interesting, which in my 6 year old mind was electricity and volcanos, and creating an army of small radio circuits.</p>

		<p>By the time I was a little older, the world had blossomed into a magical and creative place. I ended up enrolling in the school band when I was in the sixth-grade and fell in love with music. Using my newly aquired passion and drive I quickly picked up the piano, guitar, and the alto saxophone to complement the trumpet I was playing in band. Music suddenly enveloped everything in my life.</p>

		<p>Instead of absoring my other passion of science, seeking to play more music only made my curiousity grow as I started learning about acoustics and sound. While my interest in science was not sated, my plans had changed a little. I desired instead to go to college for musical composition. I wanted to write amazing thematic scores for movies and inspire people. This lead to me pursuing band buch harder in high school, joining the marching band as well as the Jazz Ensemble at Muskogee High School.</p>

		<p>I continued with my plan to go to college for music all the way until my senior year of high school. I had been rather successful in my musical endeavours, making regional and all-state bands when I would audition and even achieved a spot in the all-state choir on a whim, but none of that could keep me from my first passion after my first semested of senior year. I took an Advanced Placement Physics course and I never looked back</p>
